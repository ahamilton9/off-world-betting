# Off World Betting

I am beginning this project while unemployed as a way to keep my skills sharp, build a portfolio, and learn some new things along the way. 

## Proposal

Wouldn't it be fun to play [Fantasy Sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_sport) year-round, and based on something fantastic rather than grounded in reality, ala [Blaseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaseball)?

## Objective

Create a platform which allows players to build and join fantasy leagues in which they, along with friends or public players, draft their own teams of characters from fictional teams and compete in matches against other league members. Games will be simulated through randomization and calculation based on character statistics.

## Theme

* Mecha (Mobile Suits, Gundam, Zoids, Etc.)
* Post-Apocalyptic
* Space-Faring Sci-Fi

## Technologies

* TypeScript
* Vue 3 (Composition API)
* Laravel 12
* Bulma
* Inertia
* Vite
