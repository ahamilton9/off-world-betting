# Off World Betting

This project was started as a way to keep my skills sharp, build a portfolio, and learn some new things along the way.

## Proposal

Wouldn't it be fun to play [Fantasy Sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_sport) year-round, and based on something fantastic rather than grounded in reality, ala [Blaseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaseball)?

## Objective

Create a platform which allows players to build and join fantasy leagues in which they, along with friends or public players, draft their own teams of characters from fictional teams and compete in matches against other league members. Games will be simulated through randomization and calculation based on character statistics.

## Concerns

There are two primary concerns, both based on issues faced by Blaseball:

* _If_ the project is successful, scaling and cost have to be considered
* Blaseball relied heavily on custom content being written for each match

I believe I can handle scaling when the time comes, but I should prepare. Losing momentum due to restructuring architecture would not be ideal.

The majority of match events should be pre-programmed and automated with the ability to inject custom events as necessitated by storylines.
